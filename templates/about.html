        <h3 id="topic">What is the French Republican Calendar?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar">The French Republican calendar</a> (French: calendrier républicain français), also commonly called the French Revolutionary calendar (calendrier révolutionnaire français), was a calendar created and implemented during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days by the Paris Commune in 1871.</p>
        <p>This is a calendar born from a moment in history when the people of France were tearing down the trappings of centuries of authority. It comes from a people who are beginning to understand that even the names we give things also places a deep and profound weight on how we perceive the world. It was designed to remove religious and royalist influences. Each day it celebrates something a local Parisian would be probably be familiar with.</p>
        <p>This calendar reminds me that dreaming of a better world means to be passionate about the details of your new reality but to also to not be afraid to scrap what doesn't work.</p>
