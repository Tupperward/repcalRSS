        <h3 id="topic">Revolutionizing Time: The French Republican Calendar</h3>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar">The French Republican Calendar</a> is  a unique creation that emerged during the French Revolution. Also known as the French Revolutionary Calendar, it revolutionized the way time was perceived and utilized by the French government for approximately 12 years, from late 1793 to 1805. Interestingly, it resurfaced for a brief 18-day period during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune">the Paris Commune in 1871</a>.</p>
        <p>The French Revolutionary Calendar was a product of a time when the people of France were actively dismantling the symbols of centuries-old oppression from the church and monarchy. It symbolized the revolutionary mindset, characterized by the desire to demolish the old world and construct a new, more peaceful society free from the influence of gods or kings. The calendar even featured daily items that resonated with the lives of ordinary people near Paris, reflecting the aspiration to create a calendar that spoke directly to the common person. It was a conscious effort to strip away hierarchies and present a simple representation of a year's worth of time.</p>
        <p>Personally, I hold a deep admiration for this calendar. It serves as a reminder to envision a better world and embrace the intricacies of life. It inspires me to consider how I can incorporate the essence of this calendar into my own local context, fostering a connection to the ideals it represents. Each day, it encourages me to reflect on the significance of that day's item and its personal meaning to me. In her <a href="https://www.ursulalawrence.com/the-french-republican-wall-calendar">delightful introduction to her French Republican Wall calendar</a> Ursula Lawrence touches on the elegance of the natual portion of the calendar.</p>
        <blockquote>The authors of the original calendar thought carefully about when to honor each item. If they did it right, this version should at least be somewhat predictive of what will come into season when. For example, rhubarb almost always appears in the grocery store within a week of Rhubarb Day. Tulips, violets, and lilacs also tend to appear in sync. And for those of us living in northern climes, there is something truly appropriate about assigning coal, peat, and manure (yes, manure) to the depths of January.</blockquote>
        <p>Embrace the revolutionary spirit and let the French Republican Calendar ignite your imagination, inviting you ponder a world where time becomes a catalyst for progress and enlightenment. Also, we invite you to consider <a href="{{today.item_url}}">humble {{today.item.lower()}}</a>, at least for today.</p>

        <h3>How the Calendar Works</h3>
        <p>The Republican Calendar consisted of 12 months, each with 30 days, totaling 360 days in a year. The months were given names that reflected the natural world and seasonal activities. For example, names such as Vend√©miaire (Grape Harvest), Brumaire (Mist), and Thermidor (Heat) were used. Right now it's {{today.month}} ({{today.month_of}}).</p>
        <p>To account for the remaining days in the solar year, the Republican Calendar included five or six additional days called "complementary days" or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-culottes">"sansculottides."</a> These days were not assigned to any particular month and were dedicated to festivities and celebrations.</p>
        <p>Each month was further divided into three ten-day weeks called "decades." The days of the week were named after natural elements, such as Primidi (First day), Duodi (Second day), Tridi (Third day), and so on. The current weekday is {{today.weekday}}. The last day of each decade, called "Decadi," was considered a day of rest and reflection. In the natrual calendar, every 5th day celebrates an animal and each 10th celebrates a human-made artifact. The sansculottides each celebrate one intangible facet of the revolutionary spirit.</p>
        <p>The operation of the French Republican Calendar, with its 30-day months, 10-day weeks, and sansculottides, represents an intriguing attempt to redefine time according to the principles of the French Revolution. It serves as a testament to the revolutionary mindset of the era, challenging established norms and envisioning a society that was not only politically transformed but also temporally reimagined.</p>
